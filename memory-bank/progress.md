## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions (September 22, 2025)

1. **Memory Bank Priority**: Decided to establish complete memory bank structure first

   - **Rationale**: Custom instructions require this foundation
   - **Impact**: Ensures project continuity and proper documentation
   - **Status**: Nearly complete

2. **Phase-Based Approach**: Adopted systematic phase-based implementation

   - **Rationale**: User requested controlled progression with approval gates
   - **Impact**: Reduces risk and enables validation at each step
   - **Status**: Following plan successfully

3. **Source Preservation**: Maintain original projects unchanged
   - **Rationale**: Risk mitigation and rollback capability
   - **Impact**: Safe migration with no data loss risk
   - **Status**: Confirmed approach

### Emerging Patterns

1. **Documentation-First Strategy**: Comprehensive documentation before implementation
2. **Enterprise Standards**: Following enterprise-grade practices throughout
3. **Systematic Validation**: Testing and validation at each migration step
