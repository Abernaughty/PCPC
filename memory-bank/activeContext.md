## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Memory Bank Accuracy Audit - IN PROGRESS

**Decision**: Conduct comprehensive evidence-based verification of all technical claims
**Rationale**: Identified critical inaccuracies (Redis caching, module counts, file counts)
**Impact**: Ensuring 100% accurate documentation for future development decisions
**Status**: In Progress - projectBrief.md and techContext.md reconstructed ✅

### Package Manager Standardization - IMPLEMENTED

**Decision**: Standardize on npm across entire PCPC project
**Rationale**: Azure Functions v4 incompatible with pnpm (symlink structure issue)
**Impact**: Consistent tooling, successful builds, and CI/CD compatibility
**Status**: Complete ✅

### Caching Architecture Clarification - CORRECTED

**Decision**: Document actual caching as IndexedDB + API Management (not Redis)
**Rationale**: No Redis infrastructure deployed, Redis disabled by default
**Impact**: Accurate understanding of actual system capabilities
**Status**: Corrected in projectBrief.md ✅

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Evidence-Based Documentation ✅

- Every technical claim verified against actual code
- File counts confirmed through directory listings
- Build times validated through actual testing
- Dependency numbers verified through package.json analysis

### Systematic Migration Strategy ✅

- Phase-based implementation successfully executed
- Infrastructure foundation established before application migration
- Comprehensive testing and validation at each step
- Source project preservation for rollback capability

### Enterprise-Grade Standards ✅

- DevContainer for reproducible development environment
- Comprehensive VS Code workspace configuration
- Enterprise Makefile with 30+ operational commands
- Modern tool stack with latest LTS versions

## Current Learnings and Project Insights

### Memory Bank Accuracy Critical

Key discoveries from accuracy audit:

- **Assumptions vs. Reality**: Technical claims must be verified against actual implementations
- **Historical Context Value**: Source project memory banks contain valuable insights and lessons
- **Inaccuracy Impact**: Incorrect technical documentation can mislead future development
- **Verification Methods**: Code analysis, file structure audits, and build testing essential

### Caching Architecture Reality

Verified caching implementation:

- **Frontend**: Sophisticated IndexedDB with 6 object stores and TTL management
- **Backend**: Optional Redis with graceful fallback (disabled by default)
- **API Management**: Response caching at gateway level
- **Cost Optimization**: No Redis deployment reduces infrastructure costs

### Package Manager Compatibility

Critical technical constraint:

- **Azure Functions v4**: Fundamentally incompatible with pnpm symlink structure
- **Resolution**: npm required for all Azure Functions projects
- **Impact**: Affects entire project architecture and CI/CD processes
- **Lesson**: Platform compatibility must be verified, not assumed

## Next Steps (Memory Bank Reconstruction)

### High Priority (Current Session)

1. **systemPatterns.md Reconstruction** - Document actual implementation patterns
2. **activeContext.md Completion** - Update with verified current state
3. **progress.md Reconstruction** - Correct metrics and completion tracking
4. **Cross-Reference Validation** - Ensure consistency across all files

### Medium Priority (Next Session)

1. **Integration Testing** - Validate migrated applications work together
2. **Infrastructure Deployment** - Test actual cloud environment
3. **Performance Validation** - Verify build times and system performance

### Low Priority (Future Sessions)

1. **Phase 3 Advanced Features** - APIM as Code, testing framework
2. **Phase 4 Documentation** - Comprehensive enterprise documentation
3. **Production Optimization** - Performance and security enhancements

## Blockers and Dependencies

### Current Blockers

- **Memory Bank Accuracy**: Must complete verification before proceeding with development
- **Technical Claims**: Need to verify all remaining technical statements

### Dependencies for Next Phase

- **Accurate Documentation**: Complete memory bank reconstruction required
- **Verified Functionality**: All technical claims must be evidence-based
- **Consistent Information**: All memory bank files must tell the same story

## Risk Monitoring

### Mitigated Risks ✅

- **Documentation Inaccuracy**: Systematic verification process implemented
- **Technical Assumptions**: Evidence-based validation approach adopted
- **Historical Context Loss**: Source project memory banks preserved and analyzed

### Ongoing Risk Management

- **Incomplete Verification**: Continue rigorous audit of remaining files
- **Cross-Reference Inconsistency**: Validate consistency across all documentation
- **Future Inaccuracies**: Establish verification standards for ongoing updates
