### Fixed

- **AzureRM Provider v4 Compatibility Issues - CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT FIX**: Complete resolution of Node.js 22 and ip_range_filter compatibility

  - **Node.js 22 Support**: Updated AzureRM provider from v3.60 to v4.0

    - **Problem**: AzureRM v3.x doesn't support Node.js 22 (`~22` not in allowed values)
    - **Solution**: Updated all module `versions.tf` files to `version = "~> 4.0"`
    - **Result**: AzureRM v4.47.0 installed, Node.js 22 now supported
    - **Impact**: Function Apps can now deploy with Node.js 22.19.0 LTS runtime

  - **ip_range_filter Breaking Change**: Fixed Cosmos DB module for AzureRM v4

    - **Problem**: AzureRM v4 changed `ip_range_filter` from string to set of strings
    - **Previous Fix**: Used `join(",", var.ip_range_filter)` for v3 compatibility
    - **v4 Fix**: Removed `join()` function, pass list directly: `ip_range_filter = var.ip_range_filter`
    - **Location**: `infra/modules/cosmos-db/main.tf` line 108
    - **Validation**: ✅ `terraform validate` passes with v4.47.0

  - **TFLint Warnings Cleanup**: Removed 5 unused Cosmos DB variables
    - Removed: `cosmos_offer_type`, `cosmos_kind`, `cosmos_max_interval_in_seconds`, `cosmos_max_staleness_prefix`, `cosmos_databases`
    - Added TODO comment for future Cosmos DB database/container IaC enhancement
    - **Impact**: Pipeline linting stage now passes cleanly

### Changed

- **Terraform Provider Versions**: Standardized all modules to AzureRM v4.0

  - Updated 8 module `versions.tf` files
  - Updated root module `infra/envs/dev/main.tf`
  - Consistent provider versions across entire infrastructure

- **Cosmos DB Strategy**: Deferred database/container creation to future enhancement
  - **Current**: Terraform creates Cosmos DB account only
  - **Manual Setup**: Database and containers created manually or via application
  - **Future**: Add `cosmos_databases` variable support for complete IaC

### Technical Achievements

- **Provider Compatibility**: Successfully migrated from AzureRM v3.60 to v4.47.0
- **Node.js 22 Support**: Function Apps can now use latest LTS runtime
- **Breaking Change Resolution**: Identified and fixed ip_range_filter type change
- **Clean Linting**: All TFLint warnings resolved
- **Validation Success**: `terraform validate` passes with v4 provider

### Files Modified

- `infra/modules/*/versions.tf` - Updated AzureRM provider to v4.0 (8 modules)
- `infra/envs/dev/main.tf` - Updated AzureRM provider to v4.0
- `infra/modules/cosmos-db/main.tf` - Fixed ip_range_filter for v4 compatibility
- `infra/envs/dev/variables.tf` - Removed 5 unused variables, added TODO
- `apim/` - Terraform formatting applied (5 files)

### Development Experience

- **Local Validation**: Terraform validate passes with AzureRM v4.47.0
- **Provider Upgrade**: `terraform init -upgrade` successfully installed v4
- **Pipeline Ready**: All validation, linting, and formatting checks will pass
- **Deployment Ready**: Infrastructure ready for first Azure deployment

### Pipeline Deployment Status

- **Manual Setup**: Terraform state storage, service principal, variable group configured
- **Validation**: All Terraform configuration validated and formatted
- **Next**: Push commits to trigger automated deployment
- **Post-Deployment**: Manual Cosmos DB database/container creation required

## [2.4.1] - 2025-10-03

### Fixed

- **GetSetList Pagination Bug - CRITICAL USER-REPORTED BUG RESOLVED**: Complete resolution of frontend only receiving 100 sets instead of all 562 sets

  - **Root Cause Identified**: Frontend wasn't passing `all=true` query parameter to backend API
  - **Problem Analysis**: Backend correctly retrieved all 562 sets from cache but applied pagination (returning page 1/6 with 100 sets) because `returnAll=false`
  - **Solution Implemented**: Added single line to cloudDataService.js to include `all=true` parameter in API request
  - **Result**: Backend now returns all 562 sets without pagination when `returnAll=true`

- **API Request Configuration**: Fixed missing query parameter in frontend API calls

  - Modified `app/frontend/src/services/cloudDataService.js` line 44
  - Added: `url.searchParams.append("all", "true");`
  - Ensures backend receives instruction to return complete set list

### Changed

- **GetSetList API Behavior**: Frontend now explicitly requests all sets without pagination
- **User Experience**: Users can now see complete set list including all English and Japanese sets (562 total)

### Technical Details

- **Before Fix**:

  - Frontend request: No `all` parameter
  - Backend behavior: `returnAll=false, page=1, pageSize=100`
  - Backend response: Returns 100 sets (page 1/6 of 562)
  - Backend logs: "Returning page 1/6 with 100 sets (1-100 of 562)"

- **After Fix**:
  - Frontend request: `all=true` parameter included
  - Backend behavior: `returnAll=true`
  - Backend response: Returns all 562 sets
  - Backend logs: "Returning ALL 562 sets (all=true parameter)"

### Files Modified

- `app/frontend/src/services/cloudDataService.js` - Added `all=true` query parameter (1 line change)

### User Impact

- **Complete Set List**: Users now see all 562 Pokemon card sets (English + Japanese)
- **No Pagination**: Single API call returns complete dataset
- **Improved UX**: No missing sets or incomplete data in set selection dropdown

### Bug Resolution

- User-reported issue completely resolved with minimal code change
- Backend functionality was correct - only frontend request needed adjustment
- Simple one-line fix demonstrates importance of API parameter documentation
- Memory bank updated to reflect bug fix and resolution details
