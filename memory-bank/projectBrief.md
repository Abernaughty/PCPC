## Critical Technical Insights (Preserved)

### Package Manager Compatibility

- **Azure Functions v4 Incompatibility**: pnpm's symlink structure prevents proper function registration
- **Resolution**: npm required for all Azure Functions projects
- **Impact**: Standardized on npm across entire PCPC project

### API Integration Patterns

- **Hybrid API Strategy**: PokeData API (pricing) + Pokemon TCG API (metadata)
- **Caching Architecture**: Two-tier (IndexedDB browser storage + API Management)
- **Redis Implementation**: Optional backend service (disabled by default, graceful fallback)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with fallback mechanisms

### Infrastructure Deployment

- **Working Patterns**: Proven Terraform modules with production deployments
- **CI/CD Success**: Multi-platform pipelines with systematic debugging
- **Cost Optimization**: Development environment optimized for $0/month operation

This project brief serves as the verified foundation for all subsequent planning, implementation, and validation activities within the PCPC consolidation initiative.
