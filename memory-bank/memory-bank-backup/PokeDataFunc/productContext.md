# Product Context - PokeData Function App

## Problem Domain
Pokémon Trading Card Game enthusiasts and developers need reliable, fast access to comprehensive card and set data. Existing solutions often lack:
- Proper caching for performance
- Consistent pagination
- Real-time data freshness
- Developer-friendly API structure

## Solution Architecture
Azure Function App serving as middleware between clients and PokeData API:

### Data Flow
1. Client requests → Azure Function endpoint
2. Check Redis cache for existing data
3. If cache miss → Fetch from PokeData API
4. Process/enhance data with metadata
5. Cache results with TTL
6. Return paginated response to client

### Key Features
- **Smart Caching**: 7-day TTL for sets (rarely change), shorter for dynamic data
- **Data Enhancement**: Add release years, recent flags, sorting
- **Pagination**: Configurable page sizes with metadata
- **Language Filtering**: Support for English/Japanese content
- **Cache Management**: Force refresh capability

## Performance Considerations
- Redis caching reduces API calls to PokeData
- Pagination prevents large response payloads
- Background refresh maintains data freshness
- Error handling with graceful degradation

## Integration Points
- **PokeData API**: Primary data source
- **Redis Cache**: Performance layer
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: Persistence store
- **Client Applications**: RESTful consumers
