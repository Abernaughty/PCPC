# Product Context

## Overview
This document explains why the PokeData project exists, the problems it solves, how it should work, and the user experience goals.

## Why This Project Exists
The PokeData project exists to address a common challenge faced by Pokémon card collectors and enthusiasts: accessing reliable and comprehensive pricing information for Pokémon cards. The Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) has thousands of cards across numerous sets, with prices that can vary significantly based on condition, edition, and market trends.

Collectors often need to check multiple sources to get accurate pricing information, which is time-consuming and can lead to inconsistent data. PokeData centralizes this process by aggregating pricing data from various sources into a single, easy-to-use interface, saving collectors time and helping them make more informed decisions about buying, selling, or trading cards.

Additionally, the project serves as a practical demonstration of modern web development techniques, including:
- Cloud-first architecture with Azure services
- Serverless backend with Azure Functions
- Advanced caching strategies with Cosmos DB
- Frontend development with Svelte
- API integration and data handling
- Responsive UI design with modern patterns

## Problems It Solves

1. **Fragmented Pricing Information**: Collectors typically need to check multiple websites to get comprehensive pricing data for a single card. PokeData consolidates pricing from various sources into one interface.

2. **Inefficient Search Process**: Finding specific cards across thousands of options can be cumbersome. PokeData streamlines this with a two-step search process (set selection followed by card selection) and searchable dropdowns.

3. **Inconsistent Data Presentation**: Different pricing sources present data in different formats. PokeData standardizes the presentation for easier comparison.

4. **Performance Limitations**: Traditional card browsing can be slow with large datasets. PokeData uses on-demand loading and intelligent caching for sub-second response times.

5. **Zero-Value Results Confusion**: Some pricing sources return $0 or null values for cards they don't track. PokeData filters these out to avoid confusion.

6. **Variant Identification Challenges**: Cards often have multiple variants (holo, reverse holo, etc.) with different values. PokeData supports variant selection for more accurate pricing.

7. **Limited Pricing Sources**: Many tools only show basic market prices. PokeData includes professional graded card values (PSA, CGC) and multiple market sources.

## How It Should Work

### User Flow
1. **Set Selection**: User selects a Pokémon card set from a searchable dropdown list with 555+ sets and enhanced metadata.
2. **Card Selection**: After selecting a set, user chooses a specific card from that set using a searchable dropdown that handles large card lists efficiently.
3. **Price Retrieval**: User clicks "Get Price" to fetch comprehensive pricing data including graded card values.
4. **Results Display**: The application displays pricing information from multiple sources in a professional side-by-side layout with card images.
5. **Variant Selection** (when applicable): If a card has multiple variants, the user can select the specific variant to see its pricing.

### Technical Architecture
1. **Cloud-First Backend**: 
   - Azure Functions for serverless API endpoints
   - Azure Cosmos DB for optimized card data storage
   - Azure API Management for rate limiting and monitoring

2. **Data Management**:
   - Hybrid API integration (Pokémon TCG API + PokeData API)
   - Caching strategy (Cosmos DB → External APIs)
   - On-demand image loading for optimal performance
   - Intelligent batch operations for database efficiency

3. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Set lists cached with 7-day TTL
   - Card lists cached with 24-hour TTL
   - Pricing data with shorter expiration for freshness
   - Background refresh for popular content

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful degradation with multiple fallback levels
   - Clear error messages for users
   - Partial failure handling for resilience
   - Comprehensive logging with correlation IDs

## User Experience Goals
