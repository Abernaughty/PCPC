# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Overview

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Pokemon Card Price Checker (PCPC) project. ADRs document significant architectural decisions made during the development process, providing context, rationale, and consequences for future reference.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a standardized format:

1. **Title** - Brief description of the decision
2. **Status** - Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
3. **Context** - Background information and problem statement
4. **Decision** - The chosen solution
5. **Consequences** - Positive and negative outcomes
6. **Alternatives Considered** - Other options that were evaluated
7. **Related Decisions** - Links to other relevant ADRs

## Decision Process

1. **Identify Decision Points** - Recognize when an architectural decision needs to be made
2. **Research Options** - Investigate available alternatives and their trade-offs
3. **Document Decision** - Create ADR following the standard template
4. **Review Process** - Team review and approval (when applicable)
5. **Implementation** - Execute the decision and monitor outcomes
6. **Update Status** - Modify ADR status as needed (deprecated, superseded)

## Guidelines

### When to Create an ADR

- **Significant architectural choices** - Major framework, technology, or pattern selections
- **Cross-cutting concerns** - Decisions that affect multiple components or teams
- **Trade-off decisions** - Choices between competing alternatives with clear pros/cons
- **Constraint-driven decisions** - Solutions required by external constraints
- **Reversible but costly** - Decisions that can be changed but with significant effort

### ADR Quality Standards

- **Clear Context** - Sufficient background for understanding the decision
- **Explicit Rationale** - Clear reasoning for the chosen approach
- **Honest Consequences** - Acknowledge both benefits and drawbacks
- **Comprehensive Alternatives** - Document options considered but not chosen
- **Actionable Decisions** - Specific enough to guide implementation

## Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX]

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
[Background information and problem statement]

## Decision
[Chosen solution and approach]

## Consequences

### Positive
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]

### Negative
- [Drawback 1]
- [Drawback 2]

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: [Name]
- **Pros**: [Advantages]
- **Cons**: [Disadvantages]
- **Reason for rejection**: [Why not chosen]

### Option 2: [Name]
- **Pros**: [Advantages]
- **Cons**: [Disadvantages]
- **Reason for rejection**: [Why not chosen]

## Maintenance

ADRs should be:
- **Immutable** - Once accepted, content should not change
- **Superseded** - New ADRs can supersede old ones when decisions change
- **Referenced** - Linked from relevant documentation and code comments
- **Reviewed** - Periodically evaluated for continued relevance
