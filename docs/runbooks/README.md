## Runbook Standards

### Format Guidelines

Each runbook follows a consistent structure:

1. **Purpose** - Clear statement of runbook objectives
2. **Prerequisites** - Required access, tools, and knowledge
3. **Procedures** - Step-by-step instructions with commands
4. **Verification** - How to confirm successful completion
5. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
6. **Escalation** - When and how to escalate issues
7. **Related Resources** - Links to relevant documentation

### Usage Principles

- **Clarity**: Instructions should be executable by any team member
- **Completeness**: All necessary steps and context included
- **Accuracy**: Procedures tested and verified to work
- **Consistency**: Standardized format and terminology
- **Maintenance**: Regular updates to reflect system changes

### Access Requirements

**Required Access**:
- Azure subscription with appropriate RBAC permissions
- GitHub repository access with appropriate permissions
- Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions access
- Monitoring and alerting system access
- Communication channels (Teams, Slack, email)

**Tool Requirements**:
- Azure CLI with authentication configured
- Terraform CLI for infrastructure operations
- VS Code with necessary extensions
- Access to PCPC DevContainer environment

### Emergency Procedures

**Critical System Outage**:
1. Follow [Incident Response Runbook](./incident-response-runbook.md)
2. Assess impact and communicate status
3. Execute recovery procedures
4. Document incident for post-mortem

**Security Incident**:
1. Follow [Security Incident Runbook](./security-incident-runbook.md)
2. Isolate affected systems immediately
3. Preserve evidence and logs
4. Notify security team and stakeholders

## Runbook Maintenance

### Review Schedule

- **Monthly Review**: Verify procedures are current and accurate
- **Quarterly Update**: Incorporate system changes and lessons learned
- **Post-Incident**: Update runbooks based on incident experiences
- **Annual Overhaul**: Comprehensive review and restructuring

### Change Management

1. **Identify Changes**: System updates requiring runbook modifications
2. **Draft Updates**: Revise affected procedures and test changes
3. **Review Process**: Team review of updated procedures
4. **Approval**: Technical lead approval for critical runbooks
5. **Deployment**: Update documentation and train team

### Testing and Validation

- **Procedure Testing**: Regular execution of non-destructive procedures
- **Tabletop Exercises**: Simulated incident response scenarios
- **Documentation Validation**: Verify accuracy of commands and steps
- **Access Verification**: Ensure required permissions are documented

## Training and Competency

### Onboarding Requirements

New team members must complete:
- [ ] Read all critical runbooks (Deployment, Incident Response, Backup & Recovery)
- [ ] Complete guided walkthrough of deployment procedures
- [ ] Shadow experienced team member during maintenance window
- [ ] Participate in incident response simulation exercise

### Ongoing Training

- **Monthly**: Review one runbook with team and discuss improvements
- **Quarterly**: Conduct incident response tabletop exercise
- **Annually**: Complete comprehensive runbook training for all team members

### Competency Assessment

Team members should demonstrate ability to:
- Execute deployment procedures independently
- Respond appropriately to common incident scenarios
- Escalate issues following proper procedures
- Document actions taken during operations
