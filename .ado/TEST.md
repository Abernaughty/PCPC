# PR Validation Pipeline Test

This file was created to test the PR validation pipeline.

## Test Details

- **Date:** October 5, 2025
- **Branch:** test/pr-pipeline
- **Purpose:** Verify PR validation pipeline triggers and runs successfully

## Expected Results

The PR validation pipeline should:
1. âœ… Trigger automatically when PR is created
2. âœ… Run all 5 stages (Frontend, Backend, Infrastructure, APIM, Summary)
3. âœ… Complete in 5-10 minutes
4. âœ… Report all validation results
5. âœ… Publish test results and code coverage

## Pipeline Stages

- **Frontend Validation** - Lint, test (17 tests), build, security
- **Backend Validation** - Lint, TypeScript check, test (9 tests), build, security
- **Infrastructure Validation** - Terraform format, validate, TFLint, Checkov
- **APIM Validation** - OpenAPI spec, XML policies, structure
- **Summary** - Aggregated results

If this test passes, the PR validation pipeline is working correctly! ðŸŽ‰
